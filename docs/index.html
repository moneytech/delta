    Delta is a general-purpose programming language that helps you be more
    productive at writing efficient software. It supports both low-level and
    high-level programming, including functional and object-oriented programming
    patterns.

        <h4>Performance</h4>
        <p>
            Delta follows the "pay only for what you use" principle, avoiding
            many of the performance pitfalls of C++. The compiler is built on
            top of the LLVM compiler infrastructure, leveraging its current and
            future optimizations to generate efficient native code.

        <h4>Productivity</h4>
        <p>
            Delta optimizes the edit-compile-run cycle, from avoiding
            unnecessary boilerplate to fast compilations. Delta has a syntax
            that is immediately familiar to programmers used to C-based
            languages, as well as a toolbox of practical language and library
            features.

        <h4>Fail fast</h4>
        <p>
            Delta helps catch programming errors early with compile-time
            null-safety, overflow and bounds checks, uninitialized variable
            detection, and more. These checks can be disabled to squeeze an
            extra bit of performance.

        <h4>C/C++ interoperability</h4>
        <p>
            Delta lets you use existing C libraries &mdash; or expose a C API
            &mdash; with zero overhead, without having to write bindings or
            other glue code. The similar syntax also makes it easy to convert
            C/C++ code into Delta.
